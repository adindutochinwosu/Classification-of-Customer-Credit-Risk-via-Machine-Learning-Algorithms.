# Classification-of-Customer-Credit-Risk-via-Machine-Learning-Algorithms.
This project classified customers according to their credit risk using a customer transaction and demographic related dataset.

Many financial institutions suffer the risk of losing money because of bad loans. In this project, three classification techniques namely, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression and k-nearest neighbour (kNN) were implemented to classify a good risk and a bad risk customer.
In machine learning, performance measurement is vital, when we are faced with a classification problem we can rely on  AUC â€“ ROC. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) produces a graphical illustration of a classifiers performance and the curve is created by evaluating and plotting the true positive against false positive for a single classifier. The area under the curve (AUC) measures the two-dimensional area under the entire ROC curve, the higher the AUC score the better the performance of the classifier (Steen 2020). The KNN model is the better performer.
With a random number of nearest neighbour of 8, the KNN model achieved an AUC of 0.95. Optimizing KNN we then chose a range of values (1-10) for k and selected the value with the least error and most accuracy values.
