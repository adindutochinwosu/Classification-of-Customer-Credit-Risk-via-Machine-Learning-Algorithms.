# Classification-of-Customer-Credit-Risk-via-Machine-Learning-Algorithms.

This project aimed to classify customers based on their credit risk using a dataset encompassing transactional and demographic information. Given the significant financial risk associated with defaults, three classification techniques – Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) – were employed. Performance evaluation in machine learning, particularly in classification tasks, relies heavily on metrics like AUC-ROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve). This graphical representation plots true positives against false positives, with AUC quantifying the overall classifier performance. In this study, the KNN model outperformed others, achieving an AUC of 0.95 with 8 nearest neighbors. Further optimization involved testing values of k (1-10), selecting the optimal parameter set based on error minimization and accuracy maximization.
